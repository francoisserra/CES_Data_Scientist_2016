def learning_curve(estimator, X, y, cv, train_sizes=np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 5)):
    """Learning curve.

    Determines cross-validated training and test scores for different training
    set sizes.

    A cross-validation generator splits the whole dataset k times in training
    and test data. Subsets of the training set with varying sizes will be used
    to train the estimator and a score for each training subset size and the
    test set will be computed. Afterwards, the scores will be averaged over
    all k runs for each training subset size.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object type that implements the "fit" and "predict" methods
        An object of that type which is cloned for each validation.

    X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Training vector, where n_samples is the number of samples and
        n_features is the number of features.

    y : array-like, shape (n_samples) or (n_samples, n_features), optional
        Target relative to X for classification or regression;
        None for unsupervised learning.

    cv : cross-validation generator, optional
        Specific cross-validation objects can be passed, see
        sklearn.cross_validation module for the list of possible objects

    train_sizes : array-like, shape (n_ticks,), dtype float
        Relative numbers of training examples that will be used to
        generate the learning curve. If the dtype is float, it is regarded as a
        fraction of the maximum size of the training set (that is determined
        by the selected validation method), i.e. it has to be within (0, 1].
        (default: np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 5))

    Returns
    -------
    train_sizes_abs : array, shape (n_unique_ticks,), dtype int
        Numbers of training examples that has been used to generate the
        learning curve. Note that the number of ticks might be less
        than n_ticks because duplicate entries will be removed.

    train_scores : array, shape (n_ticks, n_cv_folds)
        Scores on training sets.

    test_scores : array, shape (n_ticks, n_cv_folds)
        Scores on test set.
